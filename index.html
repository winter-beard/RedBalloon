				<p>I first came across RedBalloon.work when I saw an odd job ad on LinkedIn for an "Undercover Reporter" based one town over. The ad seemed like it was written by a robot calling for the ability to "exert up to 10 pounds of force occasionally and/or a negligible amount of force frequently or constantly to lift, carry, push, pull or otherwise move objects, including the human body". The ad placed by Project Veritas, re-routed the potential applicant to its listing on RedBalloon, and I became obsessed with reading the weird ads from another political universe calling for employees to swear "declarations of faith" or "respond with their favourite gun that they own or would like to own". The job site itself markets itself as "America's #1 non-woke job board". Though the slogan is sometimes "anti-woke" or "woke-free". The site's founder, Andrew Crapuchettes, created the site in 2021, he previously ran an employment data firm though said he was pushed out for being "too Christian. Crapuchettes is an "elder" in the Moscow, Idaho Christ Church. Its pastor Douglas Wilson has openly endorsed the idea of a theocracy in America and opposed Covid vaccination. Indeed, a decent percentage of RedBalloon's ads are for Moscow, Idaho businesses. In March this year it was mentioned by Donald Trump Jr in an email to his father's campaign email list "Campaign Nucleus. Despite the prominent conservative endorsement, it has only 830 job listings. Among those employers is Turning Point USA, Alliance Defnding Freedom (designated as a hate group y the Southern Poverty Law Center), Robert Kennedy Jr's anti-vax Children's Defense Fund, and Rob Desantis' $130m Super PAC 'Never Back Down'. </p>
