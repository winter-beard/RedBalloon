				<p>	I first came across RedBalloon.work when I saw an odd job ad on LinkedIn for an "Undercover Reporter" based one town over. The ad placed by Project Veritas, re-routed the potential applicant to its listing on RedBalloon, and I became obsessed with reading the weird ads from another political universe calling for employees to swear "declarations of faith" or "include [their] favourite gun that they own or would like to own in the application". </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>	The job site itself markets itself as "America's #1 non-woke job board".  </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>	In March this year it was mentioned by Donald Trump Jr in an email to his father's campaign email list "Campaign Nucleus. Despite the prominent conservative endorsement, it has only 830 job listings. Among those employers is Turning Point USA, Alliance Defending Freedom (designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center), Robert Kennedy Jr's anti-vax Children's Defense Fund, and Rob Desantis' $130m Super PAC 'Never Back Down'. </p>

				<p>The US median wage is $39,000 higher than median RedBalloon wage, though another set of US Labour statistics had a far lower figure when accounting for hourly wages which was then only $6,000 higher than the RedBalloon median</p>

				<p>The site's founder, Andrew Crapuchettes, created the site in 2021, he previously ran an employment data firm though said he was <a href = "https://www.wired.com/story/redballoon-job-board-christian-right/">pushed out for "being too Christian" though this was disputed by others inthe company</a>. Crapuchettes is an "elder" in the Moscow, Idaho Christ Church. Its pastor Douglas Wilson has openly endorsed the idea of a theocracy in America and opposed Covid vaccination. Indeed, a disproportionate number of RedBalloon's ads are for businesses in Moscow, Idaho.</p>

				<img src = "christian_jobs_map.svg" alt = "Often times Christian businesses advertising on the conservative job engine are doing so from counties that voted for Biden in the 2020 election."</img>
				<p>Crapuchettes reputation in a prominent Church has likely impacted the audience make-up of those advertising, a large number of businesses in the most Republican counties are those that had the words "Christian", "faith-based", "biblical", "God" and "Christ" in them. Many in the form of biblical verse or to identify the business as having "Christian values". With the Supreme Court's recent decision allowing business owner's religious belief to discriminate against protected classes I wonder if people will feel less of a need to only advertise in Christian circles if the new precedent allows them to more openly discriminate against applicants expressely for attributes like their sexuality. </p>
				
			<p class = "chart-title">Preferance for in-person jobs
				<p>Another major point of difference between RedBalloon and the US workforce generally is RedBalloon's major preference for on-location listings. This mirror's founder Crapuchette's church's resistance to pandemic policies that brought about remote working conditions for many companies in the first place.</p>

				<p>	Since announcing his bid for President in late May, Desantis has quickly become the most well-funded Republican running – amassing even more funds than Trump, though largely through the repurposing of funds he raised in his bid for governor.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>	Desantis’ Presidential campaign efforts are being largely funded by the Never Back Down super PAC, a technically independent financial entity that, unlike the candidates, can accept donations of any value from wealthy individuals and corporations.  </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>	Never Back Down has reportedly raised $130 million in the second quarter of 2023 . This figure include an $80 million dollar sum that was transferred from a super PAC affiliated with DeSantis’ 2022 gubernatorial campaign which he won in a landslide. This transfer, confirmed on Never Back Down’s website, has already been subject to a formal complaint from non-profit watchdog the Campaign Legal Center.</p>	
				<p></p>
				<p>"There does seem to be a new level of brazenness about how much super PACs are appearing at campaign events and vice versa," Saurav Ghosh, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center told <i>NBC</i>. </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>	Perhaps Ghosh would see this brazenness in Never Back Down’s ads on RedBalloon, soliciting canvassers for $20 an hour for the Desantis campaign. A PAC cannot spend money directly on the candidate’s campaign, and a campaign committee cannot directly pay for things that benefit the candidate personally. Yet that line has been moved so far in favour of Super PACs by court decisions and FEC’s decision to dismiss complaints against them. </p>

			</div>
			
			<div class="opener">
				<div class="prose-container">
				<p>	With a concentration on New Hampshire very classic for primaries campaigners, Never Back Down's ownership of the advertising for campaigners is a symptom of Super PAC's growing braziness in their involvement in politics. It begs the question what is "direct" spending on a campaign if not this?</p>
